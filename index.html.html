<u>ABOUT TREES</u></h1></font></pre>
<pre><center><font size="6" color="blue" face="Cambria">
		Trees provide many things, like oxygen, food, shelter and more,
	   to all living creatures. They are also an important source of 
	   medicine. Trees have even been found to help make the places 
	   we live in less polluted by filtering the air. They consume
	 carbon dioxide and clean the air,and give us oxygen to
	 breathe in.</font></center></pre>
